# Simple Python Project

This is a simple Python project that demonstrates the usage of modular programming. The project consists of three main files: `main.py`, `art.py`, and `words.py`. The project generates ASCII art and displays random words using these modular components.

## Files

### 1. `main.py`

This is the main entry point of the program. It orchestrates the flow of the application by importing functions from `art.py` and `words.py`. To run the program, execute the following file:

main.py

## 2. 'art.py'
This file contains functions related to generating ASCII art. It provides a function named generate_art that returns ASCII art as a string. The main.py file imports and utilizes this function to display the art.

## 3. 'words.py'
This file is responsible for handling words in the project. It includes a function named get_random_word that returns a random word from a predefined list. The main.py file imports and uses this function to display a random word.
